## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop first workflow

### What I learned

The mobile view of the project changes the order of the elements in the page. It adds to my knowledge to get the syntax used in re-ordering the page for the mobile view.
```
.text__section {
    order:2;
} 
```
Changing the background color of the image thereby making the image blend with the background color of the section where the image is located.
```
.pics__section{
    background-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Useful resources
